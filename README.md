# insectmodelreconstructionapplication
This was a graduate project I did at WWU as part of a partnership with the Department of Ecology. The department had tons of photographs of insects from a local watershet, and what they wanted was a simple way of digitizing the photos into a 3D model. This simple prototype was a feasibilty/graduate project to do just that.
